Make a Web API using .NET Core that has two methods:
* POST /items - takes a shopping cart item from request body and saves it to a database. 
The item should have "Name" and "Cost" properties.
* GET /cart - calculates and returns the sum of all item costs.
* the sum calculation logic should be covered by unit tests
* push code to GitHub

recommendations:
* use dotnet cli to create projects using templates.
* use nUnit for unit tests
* use any familiar database
* for editing code, use Visual Studio
* for testing the Web API, use Rest Client extensions for Visual Studio Code, 
Postman or any other similar tool.
